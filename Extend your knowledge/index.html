    <p>To my understanding the guidelines of 1.1 are basically stating
      that if something is not text then it needs to have an alternative that is text</p>


    <p>To my understanding the guidelines of 1.2 are stating that if something is an audio or video
    then it needs to have captions or a transcript of the audio along with a description if its a video</p>


    <p>To my understanding the guideline of 1.3 are stating that the webpage needs to be adaptable by not
    restricting its view and or operation in a single orientation and that the sequence needs to be logical
    so anyone can follow no matter the orientation</p>


    <p>To my understanding the guideline of 1.4 are stating that the webpage needs to be have ajudstable in volume and contrast so it's visible for everyone.</p>
